      <strong> Created by developers to lift up those who endeavor to become developers. </strong><br> <br>

      Breaking into the developer industry can be difficult, especially when you haven't built a network.

      Our application, MentorMe, solves this problem. Here, bootcamp graduates register as mentors, post their review of the bootcamp they attended, the advice they have for any prospective student and the tools they recommend that will help any cohort be successful. The real impact, however, comes from the interaction between mentor and mentee. Those interested in enrolling in a software developer bootcamp register as mentees and can search for bootcamps or languages they're interested in to find mentors they can interact with. <br> <br>

      A mentee has access to a mentors account page where they will be able to review everything the mentor has to share about their experience. Most importantly, the mentee can interact with the mentor through posting messages and replying to the mentors responses. Furthermore, these messages can then be marked as helpful or inappropriate so admins can determine whether or not they need to delete a post. Any user also has the option of deleting a comment they have posted should they choose to do so. <br> <br>

     <strong> It doesn't stop there... </strong><br> <br>

      After graduation, new graduates can learn from their mentors on what to expect during the job search and the lessons they learned. Having a network is priceless. MentorMe... priceless.
